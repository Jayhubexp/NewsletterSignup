			<i>DISCLAIMER</i><br />
			This is a beginner friendly project where I tested using mailchimp API to
			subscribe users to a mailing list. You may receive mails from me, this is
			just a test to see how the project really works. If you ever do get access
			to this, it's because you're a recruiter or a close friend.
